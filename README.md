## Project's Objectives

The current project has finished Milestone 3. Throughout the project, the objective of the first milestone is to create a text-based playable version of Scrabble. The
second milestone's objective is to make a GUI-based version of the game. The third milestone's
objective is to add additional features. The additional features that have been added on this milestone is an AI, and tile multipliers. Finally, the fourth milestone's objective is to add more
features (see below in the roadmap section).


<!-- Known Issues -->
## Known Issues
These are the known issues that will be fixed in Milestone 4:
* Sometimes we'll get an error saying we didn't place any letters even if we did.
* Skip turn doesn't ask if they want to discard any or all letters and provide new ones 
* Some word get an error saying it doesn't fit there even if it does.

NOTE: These issues are mainly regarding the GUI so there will not be any tests that fail, since our tests are only for the model. 

<!-- Roadmap Ahead -->
## Roadmap Ahead
For the next milestone, more features will be added. To begin, a multiple level redo/undo will be available
to allow players to convert back and forth to and from different versions of the board throughout the game. 
Furthermore, the players will be allowed to save and reload their game.
Finally, the board will be customizable meaning that the special tiles can be placed according to the players preference.
