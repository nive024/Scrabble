## Project's Objectives

The current project has finished Milestone 4. Throughout the project, the objective of the first milestone is to create a text-based playable version of Scrabble.

The features that have been added for Milestone 4 is save & load, a customizable board, and undo & redo. 


<!-- Known Issues -->
## Known Issues
These are the known issues that will be fixed in Milestone 4:
* Sometimes we'll get an error saying we didn't place any letters even if we did.
* When an invalid play is made by the player, the AI's last play will not show up.
* Skip turn doesn't ask if they want to discard any or all letters and provide new ones 
* Some word get an error saying it doesn't fit there even if it does.

NOTE: These issues are mainly regarding the GUI so there will not be any tests that fail, since our tests are only for the model.
